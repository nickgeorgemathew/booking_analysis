| Feature / Variable                       | Observation                                                                                                                             | Hypothesis                                                                                       | Business Recommendation                                                                                                         |

| Sales Channel (Internet vs Mobile)       | Internet converts ~15.5% vs Mobile ~10.8% (χ² = 83.9, p < 0.001).                                                                       | Mobile UX has more friction (slower, smaller screen, forms harder).                              | Improve mobile UX: autofill, fewer steps, guest checkout. Shift ad spend toward high-performing channels.                       |
| Lead Time (purchase_lead / lead_bin)     | 4–7 day leads = 18.2% conversion vs 90+ days = 13.7% (χ² = 65.9, p < 0.001). T-test: converters book ~6 days earlier on average.        | Urgent travelers are more decisive, while long-lead users browse but don’t commit.               | Add urgency nudges for short-lead users ('only 3 seats left,' 'limited-time deal'). Re-market long-lead users with reminders.   |
| Stay Duration (stay_bin, length_of_stay) | 4–7 day stays = 19.4% vs 31–90 day stays = 11.8% (χ² = 704, p < 0.001). T-test: converters stay shorter (19.6 vs 23.6 days, p < 0.001). | Medium-length trips are planned & committed; long trips carry uncertainty (cost, cancellations). | Promote bundle offers (bags/meals/cancellation) for 4–14 day stays. Adjust cancellation policies for long trips to reduce risk. |
| Daypart (booking time of day)            | Afternoon ~16.7% vs Evening ~11.8% (χ² = 59.3, p < 0.001).                                                                              | Users are more likely to book during workday hours (breaks, planning).                           | Schedule push/email campaigns in morning/afternoon; test time-based pricing.                                                    |
| Flight Duration                          | Converters book slightly shorter flights (6.9h vs 7.3h, p < 0.001).                                                                     | Long flights → higher cost + fatigue → more drop-offs.                                           | Offer installment payments or insurance for long-haul trips.                                                                    |
| Passengers (num_passengers)              | Converters travel with slightly more passengers (1.65 vs 1.58, p < 0.001).                                                              | Group travel is pre-planned → higher commitment to book.                                         | Market 'family/group' bundles; highlight savings for 2+ passengers.                                                             |
| Flight Hour                              | No significant difference (p = 0.10).                                                                                                   | Booking time-of-day (exact hour) does not impact completion.                                     | No action needed here; focus efforts on more impactful drivers.                                                                 |
